## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinay10110/Lung-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd Lung-Cancer-Detection
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your configurations
   # The default values should work for most setups
   ```

5. **Download Model Weights**
   
   You need to download the trained model weights before running the application:
   
   **Option 1: Lung Cancer Only Model (Recommended for this app)**
   - Download from: [Lung Cancer Detection Weights](https://mega.nz/folder/EqInzIQS#RYUe5FHArGuBJB23WTPNVQ)
   - Extract and place the model file in `./model2/` directory
   
   **Option 2: Combined Lung + Colon Cancer Model**
   - Download from: [Lung + Colon Cancer Weights](https://mega.nz/folder/xzBDyTaa#Dc1UBX1X00qrymgM2Axjmw)
   - Extract and place the model file in `./model/` directory
   - Update your `.env` file with the correct `MODEL_PATH`

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## üîß Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `MODEL_PATH` | Path to the trained model file | `./model2/conv2d-lung_detection-98.73.h5` |

### Example .env file:
```env
# Model Configuration
MODEL_PATH=./model2/conv2d-lung_detection-98.73.h5
```
